**About me**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kirsten.
After 5 years as a secondary school German teacher and pastoral lead, I have loved using my linguistic, communication and problem solving skills to delve into the tech world on the Northcoders Data Engineering bootcamp. Due to finish in March 2024, I am currently looking for a role as a data engineer based in Manchester.
